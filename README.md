# MRW User Last Login

This plugin adds sortable Registration Date and Last Login columns to the Users admin table. This is a great tool for auditing a site and removing old users.

## Roadmap

Will I ever update this plugin again? Probably? It should work indefinitely.

- Unsure if it works on multisite. I'd love to test that. Let me know!
- If I were to add a major feature, I suspect it's to add a feature that changes a user's role to "None" / "— No role for this site —" which removes all capabilities.
